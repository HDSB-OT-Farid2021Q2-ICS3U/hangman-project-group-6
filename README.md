# Hangman Assignment

Hangman is a game where the program for it randomly chooses a name for the user to guess the letters for. The user has to enter a single letter in order to guess, and there are two conditions after that. If the user incorrectly guesses a letter for the hidden word, the program will tell the user that is not the correct letter, then shows a portion of the hangman drawing. If the user guessed the correct letter, then the program will congratulate the user for doing so. When the program determines that the user has not guessed all of the letters for the word, it will asks the user to guess another word until either **(A)** the user guessed incorrectly for 6 times, of which the program will reveal the word, then announce that the game is over and the user has lost, or **(B)** the user has guessed all of the correct letters, leading the program to congratulate the user. After the two situations, the program will let the user choose whether they want to play again or not. Should the user choose to, the program will repeat itself until the user decides not to.

# How to Run

Python 3.x and any text editor, integrated developer environment (IDE) or Repl.it must be installed on any desktop or laptop computer that has either Windows 10 or macOS as its operating system in order to run Hangman. When running an editor, run the command **git clone https://github.com/HDSB-OT-Farid2021Q2-ICS3U/hangman-project-group-6.git** in order to download and open Hangman's repository. Once the repository is open, make sure that you are on the main.py file, then click the Run button to start the program. Once the program starts, follow the on-screen prompts to play.
